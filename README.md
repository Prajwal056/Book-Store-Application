# Book Store Application

This repository contains the backend implementation for a Book Store Application.

## Sell Count Computation Logic

The sellCount for each book is computed based on the purchase history. Whenever a user purchases a book, the sellCount for that book is incremented by the quantity purchased. This ensures that the sellCount reflects the total number of copies sold for each book.

## Mechanism for Sending Email Notifications

Email notifications are sent asynchronously using a background job or message queue system. In this implementation, we use Bull, a Redis-based message queue for handling email notifications. Whenever there is a need to send an email notification, such as notifying authors about revenue or sending bulk notifications to retail users about new book releases, the corresponding task is added to the queue. A worker process listens to the queue and processes these tasks, sending the email notifications.

## Database Design and Implementation Choices

The database design is based on the provided entities: Users, Books, and Purchase History. MongoDB is used as the database system for its flexibility and scalability. Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, is utilized for defining schemas, modeling data, and interacting with the database.

1. **Users**: Different types of users are distinguished using roles (Author, Admin, Retail User). Authentication and authorization are implemented for user management.

2. **Books**: Each book has a unique identifier (bookId) and attributes such as authors, title, description, and price. The sellCount for each book is computed dynamically based on the purchase history. Additionally, book availability and stock management functionalities can be added to handle inventory efficiently.

3. **Purchase History**: Purchase records are stored in the database with unique purchaseId identifiers. These records associate users with the books they have purchased, along with purchase date, price, and quantity. Advanced analytics and reporting functionalities can be implemented to derive insights from purchase data, such as bestselling books, revenue trends, and customer behavior analysis.

4. **Email Notifications**: The use of a message queue system ensures reliable and efficient email delivery. Retry mechanisms and error handling strategies are implemented to handle failures gracefully and ensure high availability of email notification services. Additionally, email templates can be customized to provide personalized and engaging content to recipients.

5. **Security Measures**: Security features such as data encryption, HTTPS support, input validation, and access control mechanisms are implemented to safeguard sensitive information and protect against security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and CSRF attacks.

6. **Scalability and Performance**: The architecture is designed to be scalable and capable of handling increased workload and user traffic. Horizontal scaling strategies such as load balancing and clustering can be employed to distribute traffic across multiple server instances and ensure optimal performance.

7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms are in place to track system activities, diagnose errors, and monitor performance metrics. Tools such as Winston for logging and Prometheus for metrics collection can be used to gain insights into system behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively.

8. **API Documentation**: Clear and comprehensive API documentation is provided to facilitate integration with frontend applications and third-party services. Tools like Postman can be used to generate interactive API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the available endpoints.
